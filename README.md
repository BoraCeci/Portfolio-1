# Portfolio-1
This is my Sudoku Validator code that we had as a hw assignment on Operating Systems class with Prof.Fulakeza

//Feedback from professor was that my code is good but it doesn't run properly. For the same value, sometimes the output is Valid and sometimes Invalid. 
//Working on fixing that
